# Advent of Code 2022
These are my implementation of the [Advent of code 2022][adventOfCode2022]

I will try to solve all challenges. For each challenge, there will most probably multiple implementations, with various "flavours" to them.

Each challenge will be in its own module, and the flavours in different submodules. When possible, I will have one `common` module, holding the driver-class for the solution, and the flavours are implemented as pluggable elements to this driver class.
